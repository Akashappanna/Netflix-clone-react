# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `This is the Netflix clone web created with react`

All the movie related info are called using Tmdb api so before running this app
go ahead and create a account in tmdb, request for api key and go to the file
src -> components -> api -> api.js and add your api key in the API object

ex: API{key:'Your api', base:'no changes required'}

### `Dependency`

1. react-router-dom@6
2. react-youtube
3. movie-trailer
4. react-icons

### `Styling`

So for styling we have used tailwind css. Install the tailwind package. The information about the installing and configuration is avialable in tailwind css website go ahead and follow the steps once the config is done restart the development server to see the style change this is required only once not for every changes

There is bit of custom css have been used so give a try by yourself by working both on tailwind and custom css

There is still more to do
